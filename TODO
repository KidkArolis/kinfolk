Primitives
- [x] atom
- [ ] selector - single values and families
- [x] Provider
- [x] useSetter(atom)
- [x] useReducer(atom, reducer)
- [ ] useSelector(select) - read atoms, selectors

Other
- [x] check the render order, see if possible to avoid nested re-re-renders
- [ ] cleanup useSelector selectors when unmounting
- [ ] cleanup atom state when unmounting
- [ ] selector option for equality comparison
- [ ] move selector family resolution and cache into the provider tree, keep under get(fam, arg1, arg2, arg3)
- [ ] passing no deps to useSelector makes it hang
- [ ] test mounting same atom many times

V1.1
- [ ] scoped providers or creatable providers
- [ ] can we make selector recomputes lazy, mark as dirty, only read if needed?
- [ ] ability to reset / clear the atom (can we just use useSetter?)
