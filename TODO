Primitives
- [x] atom
- [x] selector
- [ ] selectorFamily
- [x] actions(atom, actions)

Hooks
- [x] Provider
- [x] useValue(atom|selector)
- [x] useSet(atom)
- [x] useReducer(atom, reducer)
- [x] useSelector(select)
- [ ] useSelectorFamily(arg => select)

Other
- [x] test setup
- [x] check the render order, see if possible to avoid nested re-re-renders
- [x] cleanup atom state when unmounting
- [x] selector option for equality comparison
- [ ] move selector family resolution and cache into the provider tree, keep under get(fam, arg1, arg2, arg3)
- [ ] migrate to React 18
- [ ] migrate to react testing library
- [ ] passing no deps to useSelector makes it hang
- [ ] test mounting same atom many times

V1.1
- [ ] scoped providers or creatable providers
- [ ] can we make selector recomputes lazy, mark as dirty, only read if needed?
- [ ] ability to reset / clear the atom (can we just use useSet?)
